    <div class="about-section">
        <p><span class="section-title">About the Project</span><br>
           Our Outcome Mapping Tool is designed to help educators and academic institutions automate the process of mapping questions to <span class="highlight">Course Outcomes (COs)</span>, <span class="highlight">Program Outcomes (POs)</span>, and <span class="highlight">Bloom’s Taxonomy Levels</span>. This tool leverages <span class="highlight">Natural Language Processing (NLP)</span>, using advanced machine learning techniques to analyze question content and assign educational outcomes based on similarity and cognitive complexity.

    <div class="goals-section">
        <p><span class="section-title">Project Goals</span></p>
        <ol class="styled-list">
            <li><strong>Automate Outcome Mapping:</strong> Quickly and accurately assign COs, POs, and Bloom’s Levels to questions, saving educators significant time and ensuring objective alignment.</li>
            <li><strong>Enhance Assessment Quality:</strong> By consistently linking questions with learning objectives, educators can create assessments that better reflect course and program goals.</li>
            <li><strong>Support Educational Transparency:</strong> The system clearly displays mapped outcomes for each question, making it easier to understand and track how assessments align with learning expectations.</li>
        </ol>

    <div class="features-section">
        <p><span class="section-title">Key Features</span></p>
        <ul class="styled-list">
            <li><strong>Automated CO and PO Mapping:</strong> Using state-of-the-art NLP models, the tool automatically identifies the most relevant Course Outcome and Program Outcome for each question.</li>
            <li><strong>Bloom’s Taxonomy Classification:</strong> The tool assigns a Bloom’s Level (Remember, Understand, Apply, etc.) based on the question's cognitive complexity, aligning it with the desired educational objective.</li>
            <li><strong>Customizable for Multiple Courses:</strong> Supports mapping across various subjects, enabling institutions to use it across departments.</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="how-it-works-section">
        <p><span class="section-title">How It Works</span></p>
        <ol class="styled-list">
            <li><strong>Question Input:</strong> Users can input questions directly into the system.</li>
            <li><strong>NLP-Powered Analysis:</strong> The tool compares the question’s intent and content with CO descriptions using Sentence-BERT embeddings.</li>
            <li><strong>Outcome Display:</strong> Within seconds, the system presents the mapped CO, PO, and Bloom’s Level for the question, helping educators immediately assess its alignment with learning objectives.</li>
        </ol>

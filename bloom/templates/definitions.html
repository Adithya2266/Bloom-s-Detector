        <h2 class="text-info mb-3">What is Bloom's Taxonomy?</h2>
        <p class="lead text-muted">
            Bloom's Taxonomy is a hierarchical framework used to classify educational learning objectives 
            into levels of complexity and specificity. It helps instructors design, assess, and categorize 
            learning activities based on cognitive skills.
        </p>
        <p><strong class="text-dark">The six levels of Bloom's Taxonomy (revised version) are:</strong></p>
        <ul class="no-bullets">
            <li><strong>Remembering:</strong> Recalling facts and basic concepts.</li>
            <li><strong>Understanding:</strong> Explaining ideas or concepts.</li>
            <li><strong>Applying:</strong> Using information in new situations.</li>
            <li><strong>Analyzing:</strong> Breaking information into parts to explore relationships.</li>
            <li><strong>Evaluating:</strong> Justifying a decision or course of action.</li>
            <li><strong>Creating:</strong> Producing new or original work.</li>

        <h2 class="text-info mb-3">What are Course Outcomes (COs)?</h2>
        <p class="lead text-muted">
            Course Outcomes (COs) are specific statements that define what a student is expected to 
            achieve at the end of a course. COs are measurable and align with Program Outcomes (POs).
        </p>
        <p><strong class="text-dark">Examples of Course Outcomes:</strong></p>
        <ul class="no-bullets">
            <li><em>"At the end of this course, students will be able to analyze sorting algorithms."</em></li>
            <li><em>"Students will design and implement database schemas."</em></li>

        <h2 class="text-info mb-3">What are Program Outcomes (POs)?</h2>
        <p class="lead text-muted">
            Program Outcomes (POs) are broad statements that describe the knowledge, skills, and attitudes 
            students should have acquired by the time they graduate from a program. These are defined by 
            national or institutional accreditation bodies and often align with industry requirements.
        </p>
        <p><strong class="text-dark">Examples of Program Outcomes:</strong></p>
        <ul class="no-bullets">
            <li><em>"Ability to apply engineering principles to solve complex problems."</em></li>
            <li><em>"Demonstrate professional ethics and responsibility in practice."</em></li>
